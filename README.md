# Landing Page Project

#Landing Page Project
This project focuses on building a dynamic and interactive landing page that demonstrates the understanding of manipulating the DOM and using modern JavaScript features such as ES2015/ES6. The page includes a smooth-scrolling navigation menu and active section highlighting.

Features
Dynamic Navigation Bar: Navigation links are built programmatically based on the content.
Smooth Scrolling: Clicking on a navigation link smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
Active Section Highlighting: As the user scrolls through the page, the currently viewed section is highlighted, providing a clear and user-friendly experience.
Dependencies
None (plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
Usage
Clone or download the repository.
Open index.html in your preferred browser.
Code Structure
JavaScript
buildNav(): Builds the navigation menu dynamically.

CSS
The styling is written based on the SMACSS architecture, including:

Base rules for foundational styling.
Layout rules for structuring the main content.
Module rules for component styling.
Theme rules for specific aesthetic choices.
Browser Compatibility
The code uses modern JavaScript and CSS features, so it's best viewed in up-to-date browsers.
